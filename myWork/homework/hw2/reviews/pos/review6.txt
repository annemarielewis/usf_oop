What an outstanding performance by the entire cast. The music was fantastic, the cinematography was beautiful, 
and the pacing of the story kept me engaged the whole time. I felt so much joy watching the characters grow 
and succeed. The writing was great and the dialogue was natural. A wonderful and uplifting film that I 
highly recommend to everyone who loves good movies.
