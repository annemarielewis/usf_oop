I absolutely loved this film from beginning to end. The story was great and the characters were wonderful. 
The acting was fantastic and the direction was excellent. It was truly an amazing experience that made me 
feel happy and inspired. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and I would gladly watch 
it again. Everything about it was awesome.
