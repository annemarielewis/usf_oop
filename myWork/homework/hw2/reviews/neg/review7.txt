This movie was a huge disappointment. The plot was boring and dragged on for far too long. The acting was poor 
and many scenes felt forced and awkward. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but nothing ever did. 
It was the worst experience sitting through such a horrible and sad film. Truly awful.
