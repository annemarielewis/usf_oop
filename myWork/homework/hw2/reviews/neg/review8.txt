I regret wasting my time watching this. The story was terrible and the characters were flat and uninteresting. 
The dialogue was awful and the jokes were not funny at all. It was a horrible mess from start to finish, 
with a disappointing ending that made no sense. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 
I hate how careless the filmmakers were with the script and the acting. Just bad all around.
