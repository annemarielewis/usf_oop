The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. Huffman coding works best when some characters appear much more frequently than others. For example, the letter e appears very often in English text, while the letter z is quite rare. By assigning shorter codes to common letters and longer codes to rare letters, we can achieve significant compression. The compression ratio depends on the frequency distribution of characters in the input text.
